# Job-Detector
A basic plugin that detects the job of the users. Useful in RP servers. 

The plugin gives two commands ("jd/jobdetect"), which will show you how many players with X job there is. The prefix for the groups.json is "jd". (For example: "jd.commandname")

If you find any problem, please contact me on Discord (Deaddiamond123#5065).

Thanks to xiluisx for the help.
